# Van Darnus Project

Van Darnus is a Final Fantasy XIV 1.23b Private Server project which aims to be _close_ to the retail experience. A lot of knowledge and data has been either lost to time or was never accurately recorded, so this project aims to base its combat formulas and balancing on Final Fantasy XI while still attempting to get _as close as possible_ to what information we do have.

This project will never be 1:1 retail accurate to 1.23b, but aims to be _fun_.
